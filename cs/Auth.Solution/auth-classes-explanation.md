# Authentication Classes Explanation

This document provides an overview of the classes used in the basic authentication template for a .NET 8 controller.

## AuthController

The `AuthController` is the main class handling authentication-related operations. It's decorated with `[ApiController]` and `[Route("api/[controller]")]` attributes, indicating it's an API controller accessible at the `/api/auth` endpoint.

Key features:
- Dependency injection of `IConfiguration` for accessing app settings.
- `Login` method: Handles user authentication and JWT generation.
- `SecureEndpoint` method: A protected endpoint accessible only to authenticated users.
- `IsValidUser` method: Placeholder for user credential validation.
- `GenerateJwtToken` method: Creates a JWT for authenticated users.

## LoginModel

This is a simple Data Transfer Object (DTO) used to receive login credentials from the client.

Properties:
- `Username`: The user's identifier.
- `Password`: The user's password.

## JwtSecurityToken

While not explicitly defined in our code, this class from the `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` namespace is crucial for JWT creation. It represents the JWT and includes:

- Issuer: The entity issuing the token.
- Audience: The intended recipient of the token.
- Claims: User-related information embedded in the token.
- Expiration: When the token becomes invalid.
- Signing Credentials: Used to sign the token for verification.

## SymmetricSecurityKey and SigningCredentials

These classes from the `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens` namespace are used in JWT generation:

- `SymmetricSecurityKey`: Represents the secret key used for signing the JWT.
- `SigningCredentials`: Combines the security key with the signing algorithm (HMACSHA256 in this case).

## ClaimsPrincipal and Claim

While not explicitly defined, these classes from the `System.Security.Claims` namespace are used in JWT authentication:

- `ClaimsPrincipal`: Represents the user's identity and is automatically created from the JWT by the authentication middleware.
- `Claim`: Individual pieces of information about the user (like username) embedded in the JWT.

This structure allows for a secure, token-based authentication system where user identity is verified on each request without needing to store session information server-side.
